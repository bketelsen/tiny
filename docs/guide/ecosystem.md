# The tiny ecosystem

Tiny creates microservices that use [NATS](https://nats.io) for communication and service discovery.

For local development, `tiny` provides a developer-friendly local NATS server by running `tiny dev`.

Tiny generates Go microservice code from a specification file. The reference for the specification is at [MuCL Reference](/reference/mucl).
